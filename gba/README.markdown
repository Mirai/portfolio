Geneva Baseball Association
====

Geneva Baseball Association is a website for youth baseball leagues to register and track players and teams for a given season.  It uses PHP, Javascript (including jQuery), and SQL integration.  This website was originally built when I was first learning PHP and SQL.  Looking back, I would definitely have written the website with an eye towards object oriented programming to make getting information and testing cases less sloppy and more streamlined.

 - training_review.php - Small example of jQuery, including an AJAX call to insert a dynamically built dropdown menu into the body of the page.
 - training_dropdown.php - Above mentioned dropdown insert.
